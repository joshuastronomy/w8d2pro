Welcome, Indy TIY Cohort 7, to our nodejs app uncommented boilerplate!  Use
these files to get projects started and have a reference for every line of
code.  There's a commented version available as well, if you want
giant files; it's in the master branch.  We'll add to this as we get more
advanced with our projects and their structure.

Be sure to star the repo for easy access!
